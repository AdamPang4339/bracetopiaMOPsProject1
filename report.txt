[insert your answers after the question and add more lines as needed.]

[PLEASE MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?
Does it: put an X inside the [] for your answer
	[] crashes when?
	[] infinite loop when it should not?
	[] only works in printed mode?
	[X] work fine?
	[] only implemented these options: [please list them]
	[] other? Explain.

How does your move strategy work? Describe briefly in English.
- FIRST VACANT POSITION - Moves first unhappy agent found to the 
first vacant position available.

============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?
- The simulation is almost always neverending with inefficient moving
strategies. The simulation will go into a "stable" endless loop.

============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?
- I was able to understand how the C language requires and uses pointers to 
pass by reference variables
- Practiced using pointers and referencing/dereferencing


What was easy about this assignment?
- The display and program output section was very easy to do especially
given the good-life homework


What gave you problems or troubles?
- The logic behind calculating happiness in each agent
- Initially figuring out how to retrieve a calculated value from external function
- Initially passing pointers and variables into function parameters


What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?
- Include more requirements for using pointers, structs, and memory allocation


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?
- Utilize structs in my implementation
- Work on manually handling memory
